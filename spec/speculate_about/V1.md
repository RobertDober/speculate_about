# Hello

The following code block, marked with `:include` is executed at the top level of the spec, that
is in the same example group in which `speculate_about <this file>` has been called:
```ruby :include
  let(:value){ 42 }
```

The next code block, marked with `:example` is wrapped into an example (`it` block), named with the location
of the code block, thusly:

```ruby :example
  expect(value).to eq(42)
```
will generate the following in the spec
```ruby
    it "Example from spec/speculations/V1.md:13" do
      expect(value).to eq(42)
    end
```
